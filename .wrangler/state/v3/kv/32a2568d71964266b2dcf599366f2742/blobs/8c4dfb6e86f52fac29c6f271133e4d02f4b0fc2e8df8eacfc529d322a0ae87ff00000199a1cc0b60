It is commonly used in object-oriented programming to access properties and methods of the current object."},{"id":2,"question":"What is the difference between 'let' and 'var' in JavaScript?","options":["Let is block-scoped, var is function-scoped","Let is function-scoped, var is block-scoped","Let is used for variables, var is used for functions","Let is used for functions, var is used for variables"],"correctAnswer":0,"explanation":"In JavaScript, 'let' is a block-scoped variable declaration, whereas 'var' is a function-scoped variable declaration. This means that 'let' variables are only accessible within the block they are declared in, whereas 'var' variables are accessible throughout the entire function."},{"id":3,"question":"What is the purpose of the 'async/await' syntax in JavaScript?","options":["To create a new thread","To create a new function","To write asynchronous code that looks synchronous","To create a new object"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The 'async/await' syntax in JavaScript is used to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. It allows developers to write asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain, by using the 'await' keyword to pause the execution of the code until the asynchronous operation is complete."}],"totalQuestions":3,"currentQuestionIndex":0,"answers":[],"score":0,"completed":false,"startTime":1759356128084,"endTime":null}
